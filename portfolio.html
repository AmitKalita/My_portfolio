            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hello there! <br>My name is Amit Kalita. I am from Guwahati,
            Assam and currently working as Civil Engineer at a PSU. But I am 
            more inclined towards Computer programming and therefore I have been
            learning web development and other courses on coding. My primary 
            purpose for learning these skills is because I want to start something
            of my own and build a viable business. 
        </p>
